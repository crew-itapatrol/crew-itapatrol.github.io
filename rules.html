        <h1>Rules and Promotion Criteria</h1>

        <h2>General Crew Rules</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>For any kind of assistance, contact the Crew Chief or Deputy Chief via assistance ticket in ⁠🆘┃support_ticket⁠.</li>
            <li>During gameplay, the main language remains Italian, but if you play in the presence of a non-Italian player, it will be mandatory to speak in English in the voice channels and during gameplay.</li>
            <li>To communicate with other players within the CnR server, it is mandatory to always use English and always be polite.</li>
            <li>During gameplay, it is preferable to use the in-game voice chat and connect to the radio [Frequency to be defined]. Voice chat on Discord should be used for temporary organization and indicate who is in the game and what roles they are playing as (Patrol Adam, Lincoln Alone).</li>
            <li>The Crew usually moves together, so it will be necessary to move in a group or patrol the same areas, so it will be easier to help Crew agents in difficulty.</li>
            <li>The ranks within the Crew are only indicative and must not lead to bullying or mobbing. Ranks will be assigned based on the member's commitment to the crew and his ability to work as a team. The final decision rests with the Crew Chief.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Promotion Criteria</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>All new crew members will be assigned the role of @deleted-role / @deleted-role and can leave the crew at any time without having to communicate or notify the @🏅 Crew Staff 🏅.</li>
            <li>Members who decide to officially remain in the crew will receive the role of @deleted-role / @deleted-role and will have the obligation to maintain the tag [ITA] on their in-game name, which will be assigned with your consent and by order of the @🏅 Crew Staff 🏅 through a ticket to the @🧩 STAFF CnR 🧩.</li>
            <li>The moment they decide to leave the crew, they have the obligation to communicate it to the @🏅 Crew Staff 🏅 and have the Tag [ITA] removed by the @🧩 STAFF CnR 🧩.</li>
            <li>The @🏅 Crew Staff 🏅 have a log that displays how many times a person joins a voice channel (of this Discord server) and plays within the server (either as a criminal or a cop). Consequentially:</li>
            <ul>
                <li>If a @👤 Crew Member Logs in more than 3 times in a week, he will be promoted.</li>
                <li>If a @👤 Crew Member does not join at all over the course of a week, then he will be demoted.</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Please therefore enter the voice channels of this Discord server whenever you enter to play on the CnR servers.</li>
        </ul>
